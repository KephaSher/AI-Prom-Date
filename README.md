## Setup

This program only supports OS X, but Windows probably works the same with some minor tweaks.

The tutorial video will come soon...

The setup comes to you in a series of steps

1. Create a python virtual environment using `python -m venv NAME_HERE`, and activate it by typing `source NAME_HERE/bin/activate`. 
2. Clone this repository and install `requirements.txt` with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3. Install [VTube Studios](https://denchisoft.com/) (You'll need a Steam account for this).
4. Get your OpenAI API setup by going [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). You'll need to create an account for OpenAI, and then create your key.
5. Get Google Cloud's Text to Speech JSON Credentials.
6. Get Loopback for audio piping (any audio piping software works, but I'm using Loopback because it's the easiest). You do have to pay a hefty price for it though.
7. Get OBS to stream VTube Studios and add captions

## Initializing Google Cloud Text to Speech
9.    First create an account and then make a new project [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome/new?hl=en).
